        <h3 class="ma-10">Based on Vue.js and adhering to the Material Design (MD) guideline, Vuetify is a full UI framework. 
          This indicates that the fundamental capabilities of both Vue and Material come standard and can be enhanced by both communities. 
          The objective is to give developers the resources they need to produce visually appealing and engaging user interfaces. 
          Vuetify offers hundreds of expertly created components from the MD specification and is simple to use. 
          Both Vue CLI-3 and all current browsers are supported. Additionally, it offers fundamental templates for Apache Cordova, 
          Simple HTML, Webpack, NUXT, PWA, and Electron.</h3>
